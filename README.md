#  Split App - Backend Assignment  -- Please refer to main branch too 


This is a backend API system for a Splitwise-style application, built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**. It allows groups of people to track shared expenses and automatically calculates who owes whom.



## Features

###  Core Features

-  Add, view, edit, delete expenses
-  People auto-added from expenses
-  Split by percentage, share, or exact amount
-  Calculate who owes/gets how much
-  Simplified settlement results

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions


git clone https://github.com/Sanketkadam3921/split-backend-app.git
cd split-backend-app
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm start

    Create a .env file:

DATABASE_URL=your_railway_database_url

Settlement Calculation Logic

    Each expense has multiple splits (e.g., Shantanu: 50%, Sanket: 50%)

    For each person:

        Calculate their total paid

        Calculate their total owed

    Final balance = paid - owed

    To simplify, we use a greedy method to minimize transactions in /settlements.

 Known Limitations

    No recurring expenses yet

    No web UI (API only)

    Basic validation in place — improvements possible
